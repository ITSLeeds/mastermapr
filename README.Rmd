# mastermapr

<!-- badges: start -->
<!-- badges: end -->

The goal of mastermapr is to make it easier to import data from Ordnance Survey's MasterMap products into R.

## Installation

<!-- You can install the released version of mastermapr from [CRAN](https://CRAN.R-project.org) with: -->

<!-- ``` r -->
<!-- install.packages("mastermapr") -->
<!-- ``` -->

Install the development version from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("itsleeds/mastermapr")
```
## Reading-in mastermap data

MasterMap products come in a zip file.
Once unzipped you can read-in MasterMap files as follows (you need to apply for a license for many of their products):

```{r example}
library(mastermapr)
## basic example code
mm_highway = read_mastermap("~/hd/data/os/Download_mastermap-roads-2019_1483661/MasterMap Highways Network_rami_3480319/", n = 3)
plot(mm_highway["roadClassification"])
```

## Next steps

So far this package has limited functionality but it may be expanded in the future.
